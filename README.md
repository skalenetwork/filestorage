Filestorage - smart contract, that controls decentralized file storage on SKALE chains.

## Description

Filestorage is a cost-effective storage layer within Ethereum capable of handling files up to 100MB. Filestorage uses UNIX-based filesystem of SKALE chains. Filestorage smart contract is a set of functions to interact with files on EVM. This contract may be predeployed on SKALE chains. It contains functions to work with Filestorage precompiled smart contracts. 

Smart contract language - Solidity 0.5.3

## API Reference

### File interaction methods

To begin the uploading process, the file should be broken into chunks of 1MB (&lt; 1MB for the last chunk) which are uploaded as separate transactions to FileStorage.sol. 
The pipeline of the uploading file is:

1.  creating empty file of fixed size on EVM by calling `startUpload`,
2.  uploading data chunk by chunk with `uploadChunk`,
3.  checking the file validity and finishing process with `finishUpload`.

#### startUpload

```solidity
function startUpload(string memory filePath, uint256 fileSize)
```

Creates empty file on EVM with specific name and size. Owner of the file - message sender. 

-   Function is called by file owner
-   Maximum amount of directories and files in one directory is **8196**
-   Maximum filesize is **100,000,000** bytes
-   Owner should have enough free space

**Parameters:**

| Parameter          | Description                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `string` filePath  | Path to the file in account directory |
| `uint256` fileSize | Uploaded file size in bytes           |

#### uploadChunk

```solidity
function uploadChunk(string memory filePath, uint position, bytes memory data)

| `uint` position   | Uploaded chunk position               |

#### finishUpload

```solidity
function finishUpload(string memory filePath)
```

Finishes uploading of the file. Checks whether all chunks are uploaded correctly.

## Build

Create an .env file with following data:

```bash
ENTRYPOINT='SKALE endpoint'
PRIVATEKEY='Private key for test account'
```

Compile `FileStorage.sol`:

```bash
truffle compile
```

## Test

Tests run only on SKALE chains. Create an .env file with following data:

```bash
ENTRYPOINT='SKALE endpoint'
SCHAIN_OWNER_PK='Private key of SKALE endpoint owner (or account with money)'
PRIVATEKEY='Private key for test account'
```

Run tests:

```bash
truffle test --network skaled
```
